# Bike Sharing Data Analysis

In this project, I'll continue to practice exploratory data visualization â€” main points are about seasonality, scatter plots, correlatio, bar plots, histograms and distribution.

I'll use time series data about bike sharing (recall that a time series is a series of data points listed in time order).

Bike sharing companies allow people to rent bikes for short trips. Someone can rent a bike from a station near their location, take a ride, and then return the bike to any other station
